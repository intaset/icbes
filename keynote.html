  <p class="body">Dr. Zhongping Chen is a Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Director of the OCT Laboratory at the University of California, Irvine.  He is a Co-founder and Chairman of OCT Medical Imaging Inc. Dr. Chen received his B.S. degree in Applied Physics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1982, his M. S. degree in Electrical Engineering in 1987, and his Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics from Cornell University in 1993.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Chenâ€™s research interests encompass the areas of biomedical photonics, microfabrication, biomaterials and biosensors. His research group has pioneered the development of functional optical coherence tomography, which simultaneously provides high resolution 3-D images of tissue structure, blood flow, and birefringence.  These functional extensions of OCT offer contrast enhancements and provide mapping of many clinically important parameters.  In addition, his group has developed a number of endoscopic and intravascular rotational and linear miniature probes for OCT and MPM imaging and translated this technology to clinical applications.  He has led numerous major research projects funded by NIH, NSF, DOD, and DARPA, including several interdisciplinary research projects such as the NIH Biomedical Research Partnership (BRP) grant and NSF Biophotonics Partnership Initiative grant.  Currently, he is the principal investigator of three NIH R01 grants.  He has published more than 200 peer-reviewed papers and review articles and holds a number of patents in the fields of biomaterials, biosensors, and biomedical imaging.  He was a WCU Scholar under the Word Class University Program at National Pusan University of South Korea.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Chen is a Fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE), a Fellow of SPIE, and a Fellow of the Optical Society of America. </p>
