  <p class="body">Dr Stephen Payne is an Associate Professor in in Biomedical Engineering at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, part of the Department of Engineering Science (and winner of a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in 2015) at the University of Oxford. His work lies primarily in mathematical modelling and signal processing related to cerebral blood flow and metabolism with the main focus on cerebral autoregulation. He has raised funding of over £1.2M in grants as a PI and been a Co-Investigator on 3 other grants (with a share of £1.3M), with funding coming from EPSRC, BBSRC, Wellcome Trust and the European Commission. His publications include 3 books (including ‘Cerebral Autoregulation’ in 2016 and ‘Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism’ in 2017), and 90 papers in international journals (h-index of 21 with over 1300 citations). He has supervised 23 DPhil students to successful completion. He is currently the Chair of CARNet and the Chair of the Organising Committee for both the 8th International Conference on Cerebral Autoregulation (June 2018) and the Royal Society meeting on Integrated Control of Cerebral Blood Flow (December 2018).</p>
