  <p class="body">Dominique  Pioletti  received  his   Master  in  Physics from  the   EPFL  in  1992  at 
Lausanne. He  pursued his education in  the same  Institution and obtained  his PhD in  
biomechanics  in  1997. He  developed original  constitutive  laws   taking into  account 
viscoelasticity in  large deformation.  Then  he  spent two years at  UCSD  as  a post-doc  
fellow   and   was   interested  in  particular  to  understand  the   molecular   and   cellular 
mechanisms   leading   to  peri-implant  osteolysis.   He  developed   at  that  time  the  
pioneer  idea  to  use   orthopedic  implant   as  drug  delivery  system  and   has   since  
proposed  different solutions  relevant  for  clinical  applications. From  2006   to 2013, 
he   was   an  Assistant   Professor   at  EPFL  and   since   August  2013,   was   appointed  
Associate Professor of  Biomechanics  at  EPFL. He  is  the director  of  the Laboratory  of  
Biomechanical  Orthopedics.  His   research  topics  include   biomechanics  of  the  
musculoskeletal  system,   mechanobiology  in  bone  and   cartilage,  drug  delivery 
system  for bone  and cartilage,  functional  tissue  engineering.  His close collaboration 
with  different hospital  departments has resulted  in  research  output  oriented  toward  
applications.</p>
